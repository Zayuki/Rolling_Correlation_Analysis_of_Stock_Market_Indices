# Rolling Correlation Analysis of Stock Market Indices

## Introduction

### What is a Stock Market Index?
- A number calculated based on share prices of a list of important companies
- A representation for the market performance

### What is a Correlation Coefficient?
- A metric to measure the strength of two indices moving in tandem with one another
- Cor. coef. = 1 means two indices will move by the same amount, and in the same direction
- Cor. coef. = -1 means two indices will move by the same amount, but in the opposite direction

### What is a rolling correlation coefficient?
- A rolling correlation, akin to a moving average, is simply the moving correlation coefficient between two time series over a specified window width.
- For example, with a window width of 24 months, the 24-month rolling correlation as at December 2020 is the correlation coefficient between two time series using data from January 2019 until December 2020 (i.e. 24 months).
